    "As you can see above, I first combine our training set and test set. I do this only because we want our bag of words representations of the training and test sets to record the frequencies of the same words (if we proccessed these sets seperately there may be words in the test set that don't appear in the training set and vice versa). This consistency between the two sets is important for when we actually use machine learning models to preform classification. After the bag of words model is created, I will seperate the data back into the same training and test sets.\n",

    "The following code cell contains the necessary code to clean up the text. This includes making all the letters lower case, removing stop words, digits, and punctuation, and stemming each word. Also, there were some special considerations that needed to be made for the body text and the tag text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the body text is in HTML format, I first used the BeautifulSoup package extract the relevant text then wrote a line of code to remove any lingering '\\n'. I noticed a lot of latex expressions in the body text so I wrote some code that stripped all of the body text of latex expressions using a regex. I decided to remove latex expressions from the text because they are comprised of a lot of symbols that don't have any semantic meaning in the english language.\n",
    "\n",
    "As for the tag text, I made the decision to tokenize each word based off each tag a question had. I also didn't bother removing the hyphen in hyphenated words. My reasoning behind this is that I believe that the tags in a question would lose its semantic meaning if we were to break up the phrases in each tag and look at each term individually. For example, the tag \\<random-forest> signals that the question is going to be about the random forest model. If we were to break down the tag into the two terms \"random\" and \"forest\", maybe the model we train would be able to deduce that the presence of the word \"forest\" may signal a question about random forests, but the word \"random\" can be used in different contexts that don't align with the topic of random forests. Therefore, I chose to keep phrases in tags together to avoid this problem."

    "Now that the text is clean we can go about creating a document term matrix. I made the decision of processing the three types of text data in our dataset independently. I did this because certain words may have different implications depending on if the word was found in the title, body, or tag. The following two code cells creates three document term matrices for each text type and concatenates them to produce the final dataset we will be working with. By passing in the min_df parameter into sklearn's CountVectorizer I was able to limit the bag of words model to only consider words that appear in at least 3% of the corpus (I chose to do 5% specifically for the tag text). This rids the matrix of insignificant terms and also limits the amount of features we will have down to a manageable size, which ended up being 396. "

Since our ultimate task of this project is to list useful questions at the top of Stack Exchange's websites, this is indeed the best metric to optimize for. We can make our models return probabilities for each question being useful and list the questions from highest probabilities to lowest. The higher a model's AUC, the more confident we are that the top of the page has more useful questions than the bottom.\n",

Because of this, for each feature in our data we will have access to it's gini importance, which measures the average gain of purity by splits of a given feature. A feature with a high gini importance means that when a split in a decision tree is made using that feature, it tends to result in nodes with higher purity (i.e. nodes that mostly consist of one type of class that we are predicting). Utilizing this knowledge, we will choose to train each of the following models with the 70 most gini important features in the data.

    "In order to get a sense of how well our model will perform the given task of promoting useful questions at the top of the page, we will run a simulation that estimates the increase in probability that the top question is useful. StackExchange's CrossValidated site lists 15 recently posted questions on the first page of the website. The naive approach would be to list the most recent posts at the top and the older posts towards the bottom. For the purposes of the simulation, we can treat the naive approach as a random sample of 15 from our test set. To calculate the increase of probability, we will run a simulation 10,000 times. On each run, will take a random sample of 15 from our test set, check to see if the first question in the sample is useful, then rank the questions based off the probabilities our models return and check to see if the question with the highest probability (the question our model would recommend to have on the top of the page) is useful. Calculating the proportion of times that each event occurs will serve as our estimated probabilities."
